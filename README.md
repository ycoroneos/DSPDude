# DSPDude
6.111 final project
People: Yanni Coroneos, Valentina Chamorro

DSPDude is a reprogrammable audio pre-amp that can be daisy-chained with
other units. Each unit takes input via SPDIF/TOSLink and transforms it
according to a user-defined, linear-phase frequency response. Output
goes to an AKM4396 codec which then outputs a differential, balanced
drive signal for an amplifier.
